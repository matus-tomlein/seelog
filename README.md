# Seelog.app – Statistics of what you've seen

Seelog reports statistics about your travels and the places that you’ve seen. It uses geotagged photos from your photo library to calculate statistics and doesn’t require any manual input or tracking. It lets you:

- Keep track of the countries, cities, regions, continents, and timezones that you visited.
- Inspect the places you visited highlighted on maps.
- Explore your travel statistics accumulated over the years or on a yearly basis.

Seelog never sends any information or photos from your library away from your phone. All the statistics are computed and stay on your phone.
