          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

          <p class="statement">
            Your privacy is critically important to us.  Your data is your own.  We make no claims to it and will only use it according to the policies outlined below.
          </p>

          <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

          <p>
            Seelog allows you to measure your daily activity. It is not transmitted outside of the app.
          </p>

          <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

          <p>
            No Personally-Identifying Information is transmitted to external locations when using Seelog.
          </p>

          <p>
            Seelog transmits non-personally identifiable information such as device type and operating system version to our servers.  This is used in aggregate to help facilitate development decisions.
          </p>

          <h3>HealthKit Data</h3>

          <p>
            If you choose to have Seelog integrate with HealthKit then the application will have access only to the health data types you opt-in to access.
          </p>

          <p>
            The health data read from HealthKit is used for display within the app.  It is not collected or disclosed outside of your local installation of the app.  Only those data types relevant to the app are accessed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Seelog requests permission to write certain data types into your HealthKit data store.  These are used when you perform a walking workout from an Apple Watch.
          </p>

          <p>
            In no case is your health data ever transfered to a 3rd party.  It is only ever kept within the application container of Seelog or transfered to your personal HealthKit data store as per your permission choices.
          </p>

          <h3>Cookies</h3>

          <p>
            A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.

          </p>

          <h3>Business Transfers</h3>

          <p>
            If Seelog, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Seelog goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Seelog may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
          </p>

          <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

          <p>
            Although most changes are likely to be minor, Seelog may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Seelog's sole discretion. Seelog encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
          </p>
